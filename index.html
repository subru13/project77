    <h1> Console Web App </h1>
    <p> The console screen is used to notify other any other developers seeing your code about any issues or notes about the website.
        Additionally, it can also be used to print any variables as a way to keep them organized for the developers. To open the 
        console screen, you simply right click on a page and select inspect. After that, you can click console on the top bar. To print 
        something on the console screen, you have to type console.log in the code and enter whatever string you want to print.
